- Exiting `vim` for the first time.
- Dependency hell. Often manifests itself through `npm` peer dependency conflicts that you have no control over, or Gradle dependencies seemingly not updating, when in reality they are being pulled from a cache you didn’t know about. Welcome to caching.
- Mispronouncing ”cache”.
- Saying “ess, queue, ell”.
- Thinking everyone *else* is a bad programmer, and that you’re the only good one. Surely your “yaml as code” idea is the most sound solution (ahem, GitHub Actions), and this “dependency injection” nonsense is just a bunch of boilerplate overhead.
- Thinking everyone *else* is a good programmer, and that you're the only bad one. Welcome to imposter syndrome.
- If you went to school for CS/software, being taught multiple inheritance, polymorphism, and recursion are practical solutions to everyday coding problems.
- Realising the dev who just joined your team that you are training is being paid more than you out the gate.
- These commands:
  - `git rebase —-abort`
  - `git commit —-no-verify`
  - `git reset —-hard`
- Having to enter a password into a terminal and saying “wait it’s not letting me type”.
- Sudden urge to move to Austin, TX and climb fake boulders in an indoor gym.
- “What if we made a JavaScript framework to fix this?”

- ”I’m a literal genius.”
- "I'm an actual idiot."
