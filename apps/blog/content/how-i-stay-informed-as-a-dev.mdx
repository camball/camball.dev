## YouTube Channels

I’m not a big movie or show watcher, but I consume quite a bit of content from YouTube, with a solid amount of it being dev-related. I have my complete, categorised list of favourite coding YouTubers listed in a separate [blog article](https://blog.camball.io/favourite-coding-youtubers).

## LinkedIn

You have to filter through a bit of junk influencer profiles, but I've managed to find a few accounts that post really powerful content. Highly recommend giving the following devs a follow:

- [Ryan Peterman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanlpeterman/) (Staff Eng, Meta)
- [Rahul Pandey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpandey1234/) (Staff Eng, FAANG)
- [Alex Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcancode/) (Former FAANG Eng)
- [Benjamin Cane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencane/) (Distinguished Eng, American Express)
- [Alex Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexxubyte/) (Co-founder, ByteByteGo; Former FAANG Eng)

## Email Lists/Newsletters

I like having great new content delivered to my inbox to remind me about topics I haven’t read about in awhile, or to inform me of new content by my favourite coding/swe YouTubers. Here’s a few that I'm subscribed to that I highly recommend:

- [ByteByteGo](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)
- [daily.dev](https://daily.dev)
- [Let’s Get Rusty](https://letsgetrusty.com)

...that you can RSS-subscribe to if you'd like. Many of these also have email lists to add to the prior section's list.
